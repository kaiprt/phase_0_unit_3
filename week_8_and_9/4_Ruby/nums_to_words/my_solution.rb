# U3.W8-9: Numbers to English Words


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode
=begin
1. Define a method, in_words, that takes an integer as an argument
2. and have it return the spelled out word of the integer
=end

# 3. Initial Solution

def in_words(num)
  if num 


# 4. Refactored Solution






# 1. DRIVER TESTS/ASSERT STATEMENTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
def assert
  raise "Error Failed!" unless yield
end

assert { in_words(4) == "four" }
assert { in_words(27) == "twenty seven" }  
assert { in_words(92) == "ninety two" }
assert { in_words(10) == "ten" }
